# Introduction

R-UI is a component library based on Vue 3.0 and TypeScript

I wrote this package because I want to put everything I learned in web
development in use and see what I can accomplish. I tried to avoid using
third-party libraries.

I strongly do not recommand use this in production, but the source code in
my opinion is worth take a look at.
